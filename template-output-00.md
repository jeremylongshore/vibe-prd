# üöÄ AI Dev Tasks: Professional Documentation Toolkit ü§ñ

Welcome to the **AI Dev Tasks Professional Documentation Toolkit**! This comprehensive collection of LLM-optimized templates transforms AI assistants into expert documentation specialists. Every template is crafted to extract maximum value from AI interactions through structured prompts, clarifying questions, and version control integration.

## üôè Credits

The original PRD template, ADR template, and task generation concepts were inspired by and adapted from [stulogy's vibe-prd](https://github.com/stulogy/vibe-prd) repository. This toolkit expands on those foundations to create a comprehensive documentation suite with 16 professional templates.

Stop wrestling with vague AI responses and start generating professional-grade documentation that meets industry standards!

## ‚ú® The Core Philosophy

Professional software development requires comprehensive documentation at every phase. This toolkit ensures that AI assistants:

1. **Ask the Right Questions:** Structured clarifying questions ensure completeness
2. **Follow Industry Standards:** Templates based on real-world professional practices
3. **Maintain Version Control:** Built-in Git integration for tracking changes
4. **Enforce Quality:** Required sections and validation checks
5. **Save Time:** Consistent format across all projects

## üìö Complete Documentation Lifecycle
