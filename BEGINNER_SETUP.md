### ðŸ¤– AI ASSISTANT PROMPT

```
I'm a complete beginner and someone gave me this GitHub repository: https://github.com/jeremylongshore/vibe-prd

I want to use this "AI Development Tasks" system to create professional documents (like PRDs, tech specs, etc.) from templates.

Please walk me through:

1. What this tool actually does (in simple terms)
2. How to install it on my computer (step by step)
3. How to create my first document
4. What commands I need to know

I'm not a developer, so please:
- Explain any technical terms
- Give me exact commands to copy/paste
- Tell me what each step does
- Help me troubleshoot if something goes wrong

My computer is: [Mac/Windows/Linux - tell the AI which one you have]

Start by explaining what this tool does in one sentence, then guide me through installation.
```

## What Will Happen

Your AI assistant will:
- âœ… Explain the tool in simple terms
- âœ… Check if you have Docker installed (and help install if not)
- âœ… Give you the exact installation command
- âœ… Walk you through creating your first document
- âœ… Explain all the templates available
- âœ… Help troubleshoot any issues

## Expected Conversation Flow

**AI:** "This tool gives you professional document templates. Instead of starting with a blank page when writing a PRD or tech spec, you get a pre-filled template with all the right sections..."

**You:** "Okay, how do I install it?"

**AI:** "First, let's check if you have Docker. Open your terminal and type..."

**You:** "What's a terminal?"

**AI:** "No problem! On Mac, press Cmd+Space and type 'Terminal'..."

And so on. The AI will guide you through everything step by step.

## If You Get Stuck

1. Tell your AI assistant exactly what error message you see
2. Tell them what step you were on
3. Ask them to explain what went wrong

The AI will help you fix it and continue.

## What You'll End Up With

After following the AI's guidance, you'll be able to run commands like:

```bash
ai-dev make help                           # See all templates
ai-dev make create T=create-prd.md N=my-prd.md   # Create a PRD
```

And get professional documents instantly, no more blank page syndrome!
