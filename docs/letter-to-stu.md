**Re:** vibe-prd repository cleanup and simplification

## Dear Stu,

Thank you for your collaboration and the original foundation you provided for this vibe-prd repository. Your work helped establish the initial structure and approach that we've built upon.

## What We've Done (With Respect)

We've recently simplified the repository to focus on a "one-paste Claude workflow" that makes enterprise documentation more accessible to beginners. Here's what changed:

### ðŸ“¦ BMAD Safely Archived (Not Deleted!)
- **Moved:** `bmad/` â†’ `archive/bmad-method/src/`
- **Preserved:** Complete BMAD source code and functionality
- **Documented:** Full reactivation guide in `archive/bmad-method/README.md`
- **Reason:** BMAD is powerful but complex for beginners; simplified workflow reduces friction

### ðŸŽ¯ New User Experience
- **Before:** Multi-step Docker workflow with form input â†’ BMAD â†’ templates
- **Now:** Single Claude Code prompt â†’ complete documentation suite
- **Benefit:** Zero setup, no dependencies, immediate results

### ðŸ“‹ Enhanced Templates Remain
- **Preserved:** All 22 enhanced enterprise templates (01-22)
- **Maintained:** Backward compatibility via symlinks
- **Location:** `professional-templates/` (unchanged)

## Why This Approach

The original BMAD integration was excellent for power users, but we found beginners struggled with:
- Docker setup requirements
- Complex workflow understanding
- Technical barriers to entry

The new one-paste approach maintains the same high-quality output while removing these barriers.

## Easy BMAD Restoration

If you prefer the original BMAD workflow, restoration is straightforward:

```bash
# Restore BMAD source
cp -r archive/bmad-method/src ./bmad
cd bmad && npm install

# Update Makefile to include BMAD targets
# (Full instructions in archive/bmad-method/README.md)
```

Everything is preserved and can be reactivated without data loss.

## Your Review Welcome

The changes are consolidated in **PR #17**: https://github.com/jeremylongshore/vibe-prd/pull/17

We'd genuinely appreciate your review and feedback. If you feel this direction isn't right, we can:
- Adjust the approach based on your input
- Maintain both workflows in parallel
- Revert to the original structure

## Gratitude

Your original work established the foundation that made these enhancements possible. The template quality, repository structure, and thoughtful organization you created remain the core value of this project.

The simplification honors your work by making it more accessible while preserving all the sophisticated functionality you built.

## Next Steps

No action required on your part, but if you have thoughts, concerns, or suggestions:
- Comment on PR #17
- Open an issue
- Reach out directly

Thanks again for the solid foundation and collaborative spirit.

**Best regards,**
Jeremy

**P.S.** â€” The 22 enhanced templates you helped develop are now being used in a workflow that can generate complete enterprise documentation suites in under 2 minutes. It's pretty amazing to see the work scaled to this level of accessibility.
