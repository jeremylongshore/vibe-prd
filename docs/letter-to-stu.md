# ðŸ“¬ Letter to Stu

Hi Stu,

Thanks for the groundwork on vibe-prd. We simplified the default path so anyone can use it in minutes:

- âœ… One-paste Claude workflow (no Docker or local setup)
- âœ… BMAD fully preserved under `archive/bmad-method/` with a restoration guide
- âœ… 22 enterprise templates enhanced and standardized
- âœ… CI verifies template presence and basic output sanity
- âœ… README clearly explains the new "paste â†’ docs" flow

The goal was to reduce friction for newcomers while keeping your original direction intact and restorable.
Appreciate your foundation â€” this should help more people get value fast.

â€” Jeremy
