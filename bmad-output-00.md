# 📋 TEMPLATE SYSTEM (13 YAML Templates)

## Advanced YAML Template Architecture
Unlike simple placeholder templates, BMAD uses sophisticated YAML-based templates with:
- **Interactive Workflows**: `elicit: true` for user interaction
- **Conditional Sections**: Based on project requirements
- **Nested Structures**: Hierarchical document organization
- **Advanced Elicitation**: Guided requirement gathering
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in validation workflows

## 1. PRD Template (prd-tmpl.yaml) - 204 Lines
