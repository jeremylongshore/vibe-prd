```

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Form-to-BMAD Bridge
```bash
# User experience remains simple
ai-dev make create T=product-idea-form.md N=my-startup.md

# User fills out simple form:
# - What problem does this solve?
# - Who is your target user?
# - What's your budget/timeline?
# - What technical skills do you have?

# Behind the scenes magic
ai-dev make execute-bmad N=my-startup.md
# → Triggers full BMAD agent workflow
# → Analyst researches market
# → PM creates comprehensive PRD
# → Architect designs system
# → Dev creates implementation plan
# → QA defines testing strategy
```

#### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience
```bash
# Super simple for non-tech users
ai-dev startup --idea "Food delivery for seniors"
# Prompts user through guided questions
# Executes full BMAD workflow automatically
# Delivers complete business plan + tech implementation
```

create-product:
	@echo "💡 Let's build your product idea!"
	@node /opt/bridge/guided-setup.js
	@make execute-bmad N=generated-input.md
```

### User Journey Comparison

#### Current ai-dev Workflow
```
User Input: "I need a PRD"
↓
ai-dev make create T=create-prd.md N=feature.md
↓
User fills template manually
↓
Result: PRD template with user content
Time: 30 minutes to 2 hours
```

#### Enhanced ai-dev + BMAD Workflow
```
User Input: "I have a startup idea"
↓
ai-dev startup --guided
↓ (Automatic execution)
Market Research → PRD → Architecture → Implementation Plan → QA Strategy
↓
Result: Complete product development package
Time: 5-10 minutes (mostly automated)
```

### Complexity Management

#### Abstraction Layers
1. **Beginner Layer:** Simple forms, full automation
2. **Intermediate Layer:** Choose which agents to run
3. **Advanced Layer:** Direct BMAD agent interaction
4. **Expert Layer:** Custom agent modification

#### Progressive Disclosure
```bash
# Level 1: Complete automation
ai-dev startup --idea "My app idea"

# Level 2: Choose workflow stages
ai-dev workflow --stages analysis,planning,architecture

# Level 3: Specific agent interaction
ai-dev agent analyst --input my-brief.md

# Level 4: Raw BMAD access
bmad-raw analyst --advanced-config config.yaml
```
