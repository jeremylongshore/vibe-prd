# Best Practices for AI Development Workflow

## Document Naming Conventions

### Consistent Naming Patterns
- **PRDs:** `prd-feature-name.md` (e.g., `prd-user-authentication.md`)
- **ADRs:** `adr-NNN-decision-topic.md` (e.g., `adr-001-database-choice.md`)
- **Tech Specs:** `tech-spec-feature-name.md` (e.g., `tech-spec-payment-api.md`)
- **Tasks:** `tasks-feature-name.md` (e.g., `tasks-user-authentication.md`)

### File Organization

## Document Lifecycle Management

### 1. Creation Phase
- Start with templates - never write from scratch
- Include creation date and initial status
- Assign clear ownership and stakeholders
- Set review schedule and approval gates

### 2. Review Cadence
- **PRDs:** Review before any implementation starts
- **ADRs:** Review with technical leads and stakeholders
- **Tech Specs:** Review with implementation team
- **Tasks:** Review for estimation accuracy and dependencies

### 3. Maintenance Schedule
- **Weekly:** Update pipeline status in project README
- **Per Sprint:** Review and update active documents
- **Monthly:** Archive completed features, update SOPs
- **Quarterly:** Review and update methodology

## ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Hygiene

### When to Create ADRs
- Significant technology choices (database, framework, architecture pattern)
- Security implementations (authentication, authorization, encryption)
- Performance optimizations that affect system design
- Integration patterns with external systems
- Development workflow changes

### ADR Quality Standards
- **Context:** Clear explanation of the decision-forcing event
- **Options Considered:** At least 2-3 alternatives with pros/cons
- **Decision:** Explicit choice with clear rationale
- **Consequences:** Expected positive and negative outcomes
- **Review Date:** When to revisit this decision

### ADR Lifecycle
1. **Proposed** - Initial draft for discussion
2. **Accepted** - Decision approved and implemented
3. **Superseded** - Replaced by newer ADR (link to replacement)
4. **Deprecated** - No longer relevant but kept for historical context

## Template Customization Guidelines

### When to Customize Templates
- Industry-specific requirements (healthcare, finance, etc.)
- Organizational compliance needs
- Team-specific workflow requirements
- Project-type variations (mobile, web, API, etc.)

### How to Customize Safely
1. **Fork, Don't Modify:** Create organization-specific template repository
2. **Document Changes:** Track all customizations in changelog
3. **Maintain Compatibility:** Keep core structure for tool compatibility
4. **Version Templates:** Use semantic versioning for template changes

### Template Enhancement Process
1. Identify improvement need during template usage
2. Draft enhancement proposal with rationale
3. Test enhanced template on pilot project
4. Gather feedback from team members
5. Update master template repository
6. Communicate changes to all template users

## Team Collaboration Patterns

### Role Assignments
- **Product Owner:** Creates and maintains PRDs
- **Tech Lead:** Reviews ADRs and tech specs
- **Development Team:** Creates task breakdowns and implementation specs
- **QA Team:** Creates test plans and validation criteria
- **DevOps Team:** Creates runbooks and deployment procedures

### Communication Protocols
- **Document Updates:** Notify stakeholders of significant changes
- **Decision Points:** Use ADRs to record team decisions
- **Status Updates:** Maintain pipeline status in project README
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Regular team reviews of completed documents

## Quality Assurance

### Document Review Checklist
- [ ] Uses approved template format
- [ ] Includes all required sections
- [ ] Has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Identifies risks and dependencies
- [ ] Specifies review and approval process
- [ ] Links to related documents
- [ ] Uses consistent terminology
- [ ] Includes realistic timelines

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Over-specification:** Too much detail in early phases
- **Under-specification:** Missing critical requirements
- **Inconsistent Terminology:** Different terms for same concepts
- **Orphaned Documents:** Documents not linked to workflow
- **Stale Status:** Pipeline status not updated regularly

## Success Metrics

### Individual Project Level
- **Documentation Coverage:** All features have complete documentation
- **Review Efficiency:** Documents approved within SLA timeframes
- **Implementation Accuracy:** Code matches specifications
- **Change Management:** Updates flow through documentation first

### Team/Organization Level
- **Onboarding Speed:** New team members productive faster
- **Knowledge Retention:** Critical decisions preserved in ADRs
- **Quality Consistency:** Similar quality across all projects
- **Scalability:** Methodology works as team grows
