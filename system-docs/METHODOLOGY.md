# AI Development Methodology

## Core Principles

1. **Template-Driven Development** - Standardized document formats prevent inconsistency
2. **Incremental Verification** - Human review gates at each milestone catch issues early
3. **Context Preservation** - Complete documentation trail maintains AI context across sessions
4. **Scalable Architecture** - Single workflow works for individuals and organizations

## The Problem with Ad-Hoc AI Development

- **Inconsistent Output:** Every AI session produces different quality and format
- **Lost Context:** AI forgets previous decisions between sessions
- **No Progress Tracking:** Difficult to know what's been completed vs. what's planned
- **Missing Review Points:** Changes go directly to code without architectural review
- **Team Onboarding Issues:** No standard way to bring new developers up to speed

## The vibe-prd Solution

### Template Library Approach
- 16+ professional templates covering full SDLC
- Consistent structure and quality across all documents
- Industry-standard formats (PRD, ADR, Tech Spec, etc.)
- Reusable across projects and teams

### Human Review Checkpoints
1. **PRD Review** - Business requirements validation
2. **Architecture Review** - Technical decisions approval
3. **Specification Review** - Implementation details verification
4. **Task Review** - Work breakdown prioritization
5. **Implementation Review** - Code quality and completion

### Three Usage Modes
1. **Single Project** - Use vibe-prd directly in one project repository
2. **Project Pipeline** - Add ai-dev structure to existing projects
3. **Workspace-wide** - Central template library serving multiple projects

## Quality Gates

Each document type has specific quality criteria that must be met before proceeding:

- **PRD:** Clear business objectives, testable acceptance criteria, realistic timelines
- **ADR:** Well-reasoned decisions, considered alternatives, clear consequences
- **Tech Spec:** Complete API design, data models, error handling, security considerations
- **Tasks:** Properly sized work items, clear dependencies, realistic estimates

This methodology transforms AI from an unpredictable code generator into a reliable development partner.
