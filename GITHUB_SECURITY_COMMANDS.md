## üö® Disable Branch Protection (For Development)

```

**Use when:** Need to push directly to main or merge without PR reviews during rapid development.

## üîí Re-enable Branch Protection (After Development)

```bash
# Restore production-ready branch protection
gh api repos/jeremylongshore/vibe-prd/branches/main/protection -X PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":[]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1}'
```
