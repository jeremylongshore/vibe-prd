## 📄 PRD.md
*BMAD's analysis of the original soccer app input that got transformed*

```markdown
# BMAD Generated PRD

Source: vibe-prd/CLAUDE.md
Generated: 2025-09-16T18:37:28.882Z

## Original Input
# Project Brief

## Overview
# PRD Input: Soccer Journey App (Gamified AI MVP)

## Target Users
Most apps track stats; this one adds **AI gamification**—quests, streaks, and achievements—making the grind fun while building discipline.

## Value Proposition
We are building an AI-driven gamified soccer app for iPhone that helps players track progress, develop skills, and stay motivated. The app combines performance tracking (juggles, shots, scrimmages, practices) with gamification features like points, levels, and streaks to make training fun. AI generates personalized insights, training recommendations, and highlights player achievements over time. Our goal is to give every soccer player — from youth athletes to club competitors — a personal AI coach in their pocket that turns practice into progress.

## Goals
1.	User Engagement → Achieve 5,000+ daily active users (DAU) within the first 6 months after launch, measured via in-app analytics.

## Constraints
3.	Retention & Growth → Maintain 30%+ user retention at 90 days, proving the gamification + AI coaching loop keeps players coming back.

## Compliance
🔒 Compliance & Privacy Requirements

## Risks & Mitigations
1.	Risk: Children's Data Privacy Violations

## Assumptions
•	Automated CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions early.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.	Functional Success

## BMAD Analysis
This would contain the full BMAD agent workflow output:
- Market analysis from Analyst agent
- Product requirements from PM agent
- System architecture from Architect agent
- Implementation plan from Dev agent

Status: Container integration complete!
