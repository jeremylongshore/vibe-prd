## üìä 5. Decision Matrix

### 5.1 Evaluation Criteria
| Criteria | Weight | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 | Status Quo |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Performance** | 25% | 9 | 7 | 6 | 4 |
| **Development Speed** | 20% | 6 | 8 | 7 | 9 |
| **Maintainability** | 20% | 8 | 6 | 7 | 3 |
| **Cost Effectiveness** | 15% | 7 | 9 | 8 | 10 |
| **Risk Level** | 10% | 6 | 5 | 7 | 8 |
| **Team Readiness** | 10% | 7 | 8 | 6 | 9 |
| ****Weighted Score** | **100%** | **7.4** | **7.2** | **6.7** | **6.1** |

*Scoring: 1-10 scale where 10 is best*

### 5.2 Decision Rationale
Based on the weighted analysis, **Option 1** scores highest (7.4) primarily due to:
- Superior performance characteristics (critical for our scale)
- Strong maintainability (important for long-term evolution)
- Acceptable development complexity (manageable with current team)

While Option 2 scores well on development speed and cost, the performance limitations make it unsuitable for our projected scale requirements.
