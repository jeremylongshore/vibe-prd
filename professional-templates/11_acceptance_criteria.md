## 📋 1. Acceptance Criteria Framework & Standards

### 1.1 Gherkin Syntax Standards
**Given-When-Then Pattern:**
```gherkin
Given [initial context and preconditions]
When [user performs specific action]
Then [expected system response or outcome]
And [additional verification points]
But [negative case or exception]
```

**Quality Standards:**
- **Clear Context:** Given statements establish unambiguous starting conditions
- **Specific Actions:** When statements describe exact user interactions
- **Measurable Outcomes:** Then statements define verifiable results
- **Complete Coverage:** All scenarios and edge cases included
- **Testable Language:** Criteria can be automated with test frameworks

### 1.2 Acceptance Criteria Categories
| Category | Purpose | Pattern Template | Testing Approach |
|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Functional** | Core feature behavior | Given/When/Then scenarios | Automated unit/integration tests |
| **Performance** | Speed and efficiency | Response time constraints | Load testing and benchmarks |
| **Security** | Access and data protection | Auth/permissions scenarios | Security testing and audits |
| **Usability** | User experience | User interaction flows | Usability testing and feedback |
| **Compatibility** | Cross-platform support | Device/browser scenarios | Cross-platform testing |
| **Accessibility** | Inclusive design | Screen reader/keyboard nav | Accessibility testing tools |

  And I enter the correct password
  And I click "Sign In"
  Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
  And I should see a welcome message with my name
  And my session should be active for 24 hours
  And the login attempt should be logged successfully

Scenario: Invalid login credentials
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter email "user@example.com"
  And I enter an incorrect password
  And I click "Sign In"
  Then I should see error message "Invalid email or password"
  And I should remain on the login page
  And the failed attempt should be logged for security monitoring
  And I should not be logged in

Scenario: Account lockout after failed attempts
  Given I have failed to login 4 times in the last 15 minutes
  When I attempt to login with any credentials
  Then I should see error message "Account temporarily locked. Try again in 15 minutes."
  And my account should be locked for 15 minutes
  And a security alert should be sent to my email
  And the lockout should be logged for security review
```

### 2.2 Password Security & Validation

  When I enter a password with at least 8 characters
  And it contains at least one uppercase letter
  And it contains at least one lowercase letter
  And it contains at least one number
  And it contains at least one special character
  Then the password should be accepted
  And I should see "Strong password" indicator
  And the password should be encrypted before storage

Scenario: Weak password rejection
  Given I am creating a new password
  When I enter "password123"
  Then I should see error "Password must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character"
  And the password should not be accepted
  And I should see suggestions for improving password strength
  And no password should be stored

Scenario: Common password prevention
  Given I am creating a new password
  When I enter a password from the common passwords list
  Then I should see error "Please choose a less common password"
  And the password should not be accepted
  And I should be prompted to try a different password
```

### 2.3 Multi-Factor Authentication Criteria
**Pattern: 2FA Setup and Usage**
```gherkin
Scenario: Enable TOTP-based 2FA
  Given I am logged into my account settings
  And 2FA is currently disabled
  When I click "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
  Then I should see a QR code for authenticator app setup
  And I should see manual entry key as backup
  And I should be prompted to enter verification code
  And setup should not complete until verification succeeds

Scenario: 2FA login verification
  Given I have 2FA enabled on my account
  And I have entered correct username and password
  When I am prompted for 2FA code
  And I enter a valid TOTP code from my authenticator
  Then I should be logged in successfully
  And I should bypass 2FA for 30 days on this device (if "Remember me" selected)
  And the successful 2FA should be logged

Scenario: 2FA backup code usage
  Given I have 2FA enabled but lost my authenticator device
  When I click "Use backup code instead"
  And I enter a valid unused backup code
  Then I should be logged in successfully
  And the backup code should be marked as used
  And I should be prompted to regenerate backup codes
