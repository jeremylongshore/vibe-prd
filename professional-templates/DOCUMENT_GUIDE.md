## üí° Best Practices

1. **Start with Why**: Always begin with business value (BRD)
2. **Document Decisions**: Use ADRs for important choices
3. **Plan Before Building**: PRD ‚Üí Tech Spec ‚Üí Tasks
4. **Think Operations Early**: Create runbooks before deployment
5. **Learn from Failures**: Always do post-mortems
6. **Keep Updated**: Documents are living artifacts
7. **Version Control Everything**: Use Git for all documents
