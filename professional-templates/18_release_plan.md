# 2. Database migrations (if needed)
if [[ "$MIGRATION_REQUIRED" == "true" ]]; then
  echo "📊 Running database migrations..."
  kubectl apply -f migrations/job-migration.yaml
  kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/db-migration --timeout=300s
fi

# 3. Build and push container images
echo "🐳 Building and pushing container images..."
docker build -t myapp:$RELEASE_VERSION .
docker tag myapp:$RELEASE_VERSION myregistry.com/myapp:$RELEASE_VERSION
docker push myregistry.com/myapp:$RELEASE_VERSION

# 4. Deploy to staging for final validation

echo "✅ Rollback completed in $(date)"
```

#### Database Rollback Procedures
```sql
-- Database Rollback Strategy
-- 1. For schema changes (if backward compatible)

-- 2. For data migrations (if rollback needed)
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Restore from backup if necessary
-- RESTORE DATABASE myapp FROM BACKUP_DEVICE = '/backup/myapp_pre_release.bak'

-- Or run reverse migration scripts
-- \i migrations/rollback/001_reverse_user_table_changes.sql

-- Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01';

-- If everything looks good, commit
COMMIT;
