Show HN: vibe-prd – Generate 22 professional docs from a simple form

I got tired of staring at blank Google Docs when starting projects. Built this to generate PRDs, tech specs, API docs, etc. from a simple 9-question form.

Key features:
- One command install: curl + chmod
- Docker containerized (no dependency hell)
- Auto-updating AI backend via Renovate
- Outputs both AI analysis + structured templates

Example: Answer "building a login system" → get PRD, tech spec, API docs, task breakdown, risk assessment, etc.

Try it: https://github.com/jeremylongshore/vibe-prd

No more "how do I write a PRD?" googling. Just fill blanks in professional templates.
