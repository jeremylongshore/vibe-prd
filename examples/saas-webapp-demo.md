## User Session Transcript

```
User: /new-project

Claude: I'll help you generate professional project documentation. Let me ask a few questions to understand your project:

**1. Starting Point:** Are you building something completely new (greenfield) or improving/extending an existing system (brownfield)?

User: greenfield

Claude: **2. Audience:** Who is this primarily for?
- startup (small team, rapid iteration)
- business (established company, proven processes)
- enterprise (large organization, compliance requirements)

User: business

Claude: **3. Scope:** How comprehensive should the documentation be?
- mvp (4 core docs: PRD, tasks, brief, brainstorming)
- standard (12 docs: adds research, personas, journeys, stories, criteria, frontend, tests)
- comprehensive (all 22 docs: complete enterprise suite)

User: standard

Claude: Perfect! What's your project name? (I'll use kebab-case for the folder)

User: customer-support-saas

Claude: Great! Now I'll gather some key information to generate your documentation. Let me ask a few targeted questions:

**Project Overview:** In 2-3 sentences, what are you building and why now?

User: We're building a modern customer support ticket management platform that integrates with popular communication channels like email, chat, and social media. Current solutions are either too expensive for growing businesses or lack modern features like AI-powered ticket routing and sentiment analysis. The market timing is perfect as businesses are prioritizing customer experience post-pandemic.

Claude: **Target Users:** Who are your primary users and what pain points does this solve?

User: Our primary users are customer support managers and agents at growing SaaS companies (50-500 employees). Their main pain points are: 1) Juggling multiple support channels manually, 2) Inconsistent response times leading to unhappy customers, 3) No visibility into team performance and customer satisfaction trends.

Claude: **Technical Approach:** What's your planned technology stack and key integrations?

User: React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database, Redis for caching. Key integrations include Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail API, Zendesk migration API, Stripe for billing, and OpenAI for AI features. We'll deploy on AWS with Docker containers.

Claude: **Business Model:** How will this generate revenue and what are your key success metrics?

User: Tiered SaaS subscription model: Starter ($29/month), Professional ($79/month), Enterprise (custom pricing). Key metrics: MRR growth, customer acquisition cost, support ticket resolution time improvement, and customer satisfaction scores. Target is 100 paying customers by month 6.

Claude: Excellent! I'm generating 12 comprehensive documents for your business-focused, standard-scope project.
