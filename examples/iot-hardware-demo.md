## User Session Transcript

```
User: /new-project

Claude: I'll help you generate professional project documentation. Let me ask a few questions to understand your project:

**1. Starting Point:** Are you building something completely new (greenfield) or improving/extending an existing system (brownfield)?

User: greenfield

Claude: **2. Audience:** Who is this primarily for?
- startup (small team, rapid iteration)
- business (established company, proven processes)
- enterprise (large organization, compliance requirements)

User: enterprise

Claude: **3. Scope:** How comprehensive should the documentation be?
- mvp (4 core docs: PRD, tasks, brief, brainstorming)
- standard (12 docs: adds research, personas, journeys, stories, criteria, frontend, tests)
- comprehensive (all 22 docs: complete enterprise suite)

User: comprehensive

Claude: Perfect! What's your project name? (I'll use kebab-case for the folder)

User: agri-sensor-network

Claude: Excellent! Since this is an enterprise-comprehensive project, I'll need detailed information across all business dimensions. Let me gather the key details:

**Project Overview:** Describe your smart environmental monitoring system - what specific problem does it solve?

User: We're developing an IoT sensor network that continuously monitors soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light levels, and nutrient content across large agricultural operations. Current solutions require manual sampling and provide delayed feedback, leading to crop losses and inefficient resource usage. Our system provides real-time alerts and predictive analytics to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest management.

**Target Market:** Who are your primary customers and what's the market opportunity?

User: Primary customers are large-scale commercial farms (1000+ acres), agricultural cooperatives, and precision agriculture service providers. Secondary market includes research institutions and government agricultural departments. The precision agriculture market is $12B globally with 15% annual growth. Our addressable market is approximately $2.8B.

**Technical Architecture:** Describe your hardware and software components.

User: Hardware: Solar-powered sensor nodes with LoRaWAN connectivity, weather stations, and edge gateway devices. Each node contains multiple sensors (soil moisture, pH, temperature, NPK levels). Software: Cloud platform built on AWS IoT Core, real-time data processing with Apache Kafka, machine learning models for predictive analytics, mobile and web dashboards for farmers.

**Regulatory Requirements:** What compliance and certification requirements apply?

User: FCC certification for wireless devices, IP67 weatherproofing standards, GDPR compliance for data handling, agricultural data privacy regulations (varies by region), and FDA guidelines for soil sensors that may contact food crops. Environmental sustainability certifications for solar components.

**Business Model:** How will you monetize this and what are the key metrics?

User: Hardware sales ($500-1500 per sensor node) plus SaaS platform subscription ($5-15 per sensor per month). Revenue streams include installation services, data analytics licensing, and API access for third-party agricultural software. Key metrics: sensor deployment count, subscription retention, crop yield improvement percentage, and customer acquisition cost.

Claude: Outstanding! I'm generating all 22 comprehensive enterprise documents for your IoT agriculture project. This will include full compliance documentation, technical specifications, and business analysis.
