## User Session Transcript

```
User: /new-project

Claude: I'll help you generate professional project documentation. Let me ask a few questions to understand your project:

**1. Starting Point:** Are you building something completely new (greenfield) or improving/extending an existing system (brownfield)?

User: greenfield

Claude: **2. Audience:** Who is this primarily for?
- startup (small team, rapid iteration)
- business (established company, proven processes)
- enterprise (large organization, compliance requirements)

User: business

Claude: **3. Scope:** How comprehensive should the documentation be?
- mvp (4 core docs: PRD, tasks, brief, brainstorming)
- standard (12 docs: adds research, personas, journeys, stories, criteria, frontend, tests)
- comprehensive (all 22 docs: complete enterprise suite)

User: standard

Claude: Perfect! What's your project name? (I'll use kebab-case for the folder)

User: chat-ai-customer-support

Claude: Great! I'm generating documentation for your business-focused, standard-scope project.
