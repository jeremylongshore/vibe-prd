# Cursor Rules for Vibe Coding

## Deployment Rules
- Do not make any deployments to Vercel or Railway as an agent, unless I give explicit permission
- You can ask to make deployments, but wait for my approval before proceeding

## Git Rules
- Do not make any git commands without my explicit permission
- This includes but is not limited to: commit, push, pull, merge, reset, branch operations, etc.
- Always ask for permission before executing any git-related commands

## Mock Data
- Never generate or suggest mock data, placeholder objects, or fake API responses.
- Always attempt to connect to the real API or endpoint, even if authentication, schemas, or environment variables are missing. If connection details are unclear, explicitly ask the user for the needed information rather than fabricating data.
- Do not write `const mockData = [...]`, `sampleResponse`, `faker`, or similar.
- Only implement actual calls, request/response handling, and error handling for the real API.

## General Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the project
- Use TypeScript and React best practices
- Maintain the existing project structure and naming conventions
