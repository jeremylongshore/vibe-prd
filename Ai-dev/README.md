# 🚀 AI Dev Tasks: Professional Documentation Toolkit 🤖

Welcome to the **AI Dev Tasks Professional Documentation Toolkit**! This comprehensive collection of LLM-optimized templates transforms AI assistants into expert documentation specialists. Every template is crafted to extract maximum value from AI interactions through structured prompts, clarifying questions, and version control integration.

## 🙏 Credits

The original PRD template, ADR template, and task generation concepts were inspired by and adapted from [stulogy's vibe-prd](https://github.com/stulogy/vibe-prd) repository. This toolkit expands on those foundations to create a comprehensive documentation suite with 16 professional templates.

Stop wrestling with vague AI responses and start generating professional-grade documentation that meets industry standards!

## ✨ The Core Philosophy

Professional software development requires comprehensive documentation at every phase. This toolkit ensures that AI assistants:

1. **Ask the Right Questions:** Structured clarifying questions ensure completeness
2. **Follow Industry Standards:** Templates based on real-world professional practices
3. **Maintain Version Control:** Built-in Git integration for tracking changes
4. **Enforce Quality:** Required sections and validation checks
5. **Save Time:** Consistent format across all projects

## 📚 Complete Documentation Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Planning Documents
- **PRD** (Product Requirements Document) - Define what to build
- **BRD** (Business Requirements Document) - Capture business needs
- **RFC** (Request for Comments) - Propose major changes
- **Tech Spec** - Detailed implementation blueprint

### Phase 2: Design Documents
- **Design Doc** - System architecture and design
- **API Spec** - OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **Database Schema** - Data models and relationships
- **C4 Model** - Architecture visualization

### Phase 3: Development Documents
- **User Stories** - Agile requirements
- **Test Plans** - Testing strategy and cases
- **Task Lists** - Detailed implementation tasks

### Phase 4: Operations Documents
- **Runbook** - Operational procedures
- **Post-Mortem** - Incident analysis
- **SOP** - Standard operating procedures

### Phase 5: Architecture Documents
- **ADR** (Architecture Decision Record) - Document decisions
- **Solution Architecture** - Complete solution design

### Phase 6: Project Management
- **Project Charter** - Project initiation
- **RACI Matrix** - Responsibility assignment
- **Risk Register** - Risk tracking

## 🎯 Who Should Use This?

### Perfect For:
- **Software Engineers** building new features
- **Technical Leads** planning architecture
- **Product Managers** defining requirements
- **DevOps Engineers** documenting operations
- **Anyone** working with AI coding assistants

### Works With:
- Claude Code ✅
- Cursor ✅
- Windsurf ✅
- GitHub Copilot ✅
- Any AI that can read markdown ✅

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone or copy these templates to your project
cp -r ai-dev-tasks /path/to/your/project/

# Or install globally (see master copy instructions below)
```

### 2. Using Templates with AI

Simply tell your AI assistant:

```
"Use @ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.md to create a PRD for [feature]"
"Use @ai-dev-tasks/create-tech-spec.md for technical specification"
"Generate an RFC using @ai-dev-tasks/create-rfc.md"
```

### 3. The AI Will:
1. Read the template
2. Ask you clarifying questions
3. Generate the document
4. Save it with proper naming
5. Create version control entries

## 📋 Document Usage Guide

### When to Use Each Document:

| Document | When to Use | Who Creates | Who Reads |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **PRD** | Starting new feature | Product/Dev | Everyone |
| **BRD** | Business initiative | Business/PM | Executives |
| **RFC** | Major changes | Engineers | Tech team |
| **Tech Spec** | Before coding | Tech Lead | Developers |
| **ADR** | Architecture decisions | Architects | Tech team |
| **Design Doc** | System design | Engineers | Tech team |
| **Runbook** | Operations setup | DevOps | Ops team |
| **Post-Mortem** | After incidents | Team | Everyone |

## 🔄 Workflow Example

    A[Business Need] --> B[BRD]
    B --> C[PRD]
    C --> D[Tech Spec]
    D --> E[Design Doc]
    E --> F[Task List]
    F --> G[Implementation]
    G --> H[Runbook]
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Chain Documents Together**
Start with a BRD → Generate PRD → Create Tech Spec → Generate Tasks

### 2. **Use Version Control**
Every template includes Git commands for tracking changes

### 3. **Let AI Ask Questions**
Don't skip the clarifying questions - they ensure completeness

### 4. **Customize Templates**
Modify templates to match your organization's standards

### 5. **Create Document Sets**
Generate all related documents for a project at once
