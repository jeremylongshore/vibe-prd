# 📋 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Metadata**
- Last Updated: 2025-09-18
- Maintainer: AI-Dev Toolkit Enhancement Team
- Related Docs: new-project-command-analysis.md, existing CLAUDE.md, README.md
- Feature Type: **Brownfield Enhancement** to existing vibe-prd system

> **🎯 Executive Summary**
> This PRD defines the `/new-project` command feature addition to the existing vibe-prd AI documentation generator. This intelligent intake system will eliminate user friction by providing a single command that guides users through project documentation creation via smart questioning flows, supporting both Greenfield (new ideas) and Brownfield (existing systems) scenarios.

---

## 🚀 1. Product Vision & Problem Statement

### 1.1 One-Liner
**Product Vision:** "A single intelligent `/new-project` command that transforms vibe-prd from a template library into a guided documentation generation assistant, reducing time-to-first-doc from 15+ minutes to 5 minutes through smart questioning flows."

### 1.2 Problem Definition
- **Who hurts today:**
  - New users who don't know what questions to ask themselves
  - Experienced users tired of running 4+ separate commands
  - Teams needing consistent documentation across different project types

- **Current pain points:**
  - **Cognitive overhead:** Users must formulate their own questions
  - **Command sprawl:** 4 separate commands (/create-prd, /create-adr, /generate-tasks, /process-tasks)
  - **Inconsistent depth:** No guidance for different project contexts (startup vs enterprise)
  - **Manual coordination:** Users must remember template relationships and cross-references

- **Why now:**
  - vibe-prd has proven template library (22 professional docs)
  - Dual AI support (Claude + Cursor) already established
  - User feedback indicates friction in initial project setup
  - Template system is stable and ready for intelligent orchestration

- **Cost of inaction:**
  - Continued user frustration with setup complexity
  - Reduced adoption of comprehensive documentation
  - Manual effort preventing scale to teams/organizations

**Problem Validation:**
- [x] User pain points identified through direct feedback
- [x] Current workflow analysis completed
- [x] Template interconnection mapping documented

│   ├── Starting Point Detection
│   ├── Audience Calibration
│   └── Scope Selection
├── Phase 2: Smart Interview
│   ├── Greenfield: Concept validation questions
│   ├── Brownfield: Integration impact questions
│   └── Enterprise: Compliance requirement questions
├── Phase 3: Template Generation
│   ├── Read selected templates from professional-templates/
│   ├── Replace {{DATE}} with current timestamp

    └── Display completion summary to user
```

### 4.2 Question Adaptation Logic
```python
# Pseudo-code for question flow adaptation
def adapt_questions(starting_point, audience, scope):
    base_questions = get_foundation_questions()

    if starting_point == "greenfield":
        questions += concept_validation_questions()
        questions += market_research_questions()
    elif starting_point == "brownfield":
        questions += integration_questions()
        questions += user_impact_questions()

    if audience == "enterprise":
        questions += compliance_questions()
        questions += audit_trail_questions()
    elif audience == "startup":
        questions += mvp_questions()
        questions += resource_constraint_questions()

    if scope == "comprehensive":
        questions += deep_dive_questions_per_template()

    return questions
```

### 4.3 Template Cross-Reference System
```yaml
# Template relationship mapping
template_relationships:
  01_prd.md:
    feeds_into: [03_generate_tasks.md, 06_architecture.md]
    requires_from: [05_market_research.md, 08_personas.md]

  02_adr.md:
    feeds_into: [06_architecture.md, 16_frontend_spec.md]
    requires_from: [01_prd.md]

  03_generate_tasks.md:
    feeds_into: [04_process_task_list.md, 17_test_plan.md]
    requires_from: [01_prd.md, 02_adr.md]
```
