# ðŸŽ¯ Tiered Template System: MVP to Enterprise Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-18
**Purpose:** Define template tiers based on user needs and context
**Impact:** Optimizes documentation depth for different user segments

> **ðŸš€ Revolutionary Approach:** Instead of one-size-fits-all documentation, deliver exactly what each user type needs - from rapid MVP validation to enterprise compliance requirements.

## ðŸš€ Intelligent Tier Selection Logic

### **Automatic Tier Detection**
```python
# Pseudo-code for tier recommendation
def recommend_tier(user_responses):
    tier_score = 0

    # Business context indicators
    if mentions_compliance_keywords(user_responses):
        tier_score += 20  # Enterprise indicators
    if mentions_mvp_keywords(user_responses):
        tier_score -= 10  # Startup indicators
    if mentions_team_size(user_responses):
        if team_size > 20:
            tier_score += 15  # Enterprise
        elif team_size < 5:
            tier_score -= 5   # Startup

    # Project complexity indicators
    if mentions_integration_requirements(user_responses):
        tier_score += 10
    if mentions_regulatory_requirements(user_responses):
        tier_score += 15
    if mentions_audit_requirements(user_responses):
        tier_score += 20

    # Time/resource indicators
    if mentions_tight_timeline(user_responses):
        tier_score -= 10  # Favor MVP
    if mentions_budget_constraints(user_responses):
        tier_score -= 5   # Favor leaner approach

    # Tier assignment
    if tier_score >= 25:
        return "Enterprise (22 docs)"
    elif tier_score >= 10:
        return "Standard (12 docs)"
    else:
        return "MVP (4 docs)"
```

### **User Override Options**
```markdown
Claude: "Based on your responses, I recommend the Standard tier (12 docs).
Would you like to:
(A) Use Standard tier as recommended
(B) Upgrade to Enterprise tier (22 docs) for full compliance
(C) Downgrade to MVP tier (4 docs) for faster execution
(D) Let me ask a few more questions to refine the recommendation"
```
