# 🚀 Self-Contained /new-project Command Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Project:** vibe-prd AI Documentation Generator
**Phase:** Self-Contained Command Development
**Status:** Implementation Planning

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

I am creating a completely self-contained `/new-project` command that embeds all 22 professional templates directly into a single command file. This will provide the ultimate user experience - users download one file, install it, and get the full vibe-prd documentation generation experience with zero dependencies.

## 🎯 What I'm Building

### **Core Product**
A single markdown file (`new-project-self-contained.md`) that contains:
- Complete intelligent conversation logic for project classification
- All 22 professional templates embedded as template strings
- Smart routing algorithm (Greenfield/Brownfield → MVP/Standard/Enterprise)
- Document generation engine that creates professional project directories
- Error handling and quality validation systems

### **User Experience Goal**
```
User Journey:
1. Download single file: new-project-self-contained.md
2. Copy to: ~/.claude/commands/
3. Type: /new-project (anywhere on their system)
4. Natural conversation begins automatically
5. Claude analyzes responses and routes intelligently
6. Professional documents generated in minutes
7. Complete project directory created with navigation
```

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **1. Intelligent Conversation Engine**
**What I'm implementing:**
- Natural language project discovery ("What project are you working on?")
- Response analysis using keyword detection and linguistic patterns
- Automatic classification into project types and complexity tiers
- Smart follow-up questioning when clarification needed

**How it works:**
```
User Input: "I want to build a fitness tracking app for runners"

Analysis Engine:
├── Greenfield Detection: "want to build" = new project ✓
├── Consumer App Detection: "fitness tracking app" = MVP tier ✓
├── Target User: "for runners" = B2C consumer ✓
└── Routing Decision: Greenfield + MVP → 4 documents

Claude Response: "I can see you're starting a consumer fitness app from scratch - exciting! This sounds perfect for our MVP documentation approach. I'll generate 4 essential documents to help you validate and plan your idea. This should take about 3-5 minutes. Ready to start?"
```

### **2. Embedded Template System**
**What I'm implementing:**
Complete template library embedded directly in the command file:

```markdown
# Template Storage Structure
TEMPLATE_01_PRD = """
# 📋 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Metadata**
- Last Updated: {{DATE}}
- Maintainer: AI-Dev Toolkit
- Related Docs: 03_generate_tasks.md, 04_process_task_list.md
[...complete template content...]
"""

TEMPLATE_03_GENERATE_TASKS = """
# 🛠️ Implementation Task Breakdown
**Metadata**
- Last Updated: {{DATE}}
[...complete template content...]
"""

[...all 22 templates stored as strings...]
```

**Template Population Logic:**
- Replace {{DATE}} with current date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Insert user-provided project details into appropriate sections
- Maintain professional formatting and cross-references
- Add [CUSTOMIZE] markers where user input is needed

### **3. Tiered Generation System**
**What I'm implementing:**

**MVP Tier (4 documents):**
- 01_prd.md - Product Requirements Document
- 03_generate_tasks.md - Implementation Task Breakdown
- 14_project_brief.md - Project Brief & Charter
- 15_brainstorming.md - Brainstorming & Ideation

**Standard Tier (12 documents):**
- All MVP documents PLUS:
- 02_adr.md, 05_market_research.md, 08_personas.md, 09_user_journeys.md
- 10_user_stories.md, 11_acceptance_criteria.md, 16_frontend_spec.md, 17_test_plan.md

**Enterprise Tier (22 documents):**
- Complete professional template library
- Full compliance and audit-ready documentation
- Comprehensive cross-references and navigation

### **4. Project Directory Generation**
**What I'm implementing:**
```
Output Structure:
completed-docs/[PROJECT-NAME]/
├── index.md                    # Navigation & project summary
├── .metadata/                  # Generation audit trail
│   ├── generation-log.md       # What was generated when
│   ├── assumptions-made.md     # AI assumptions for user review
│   └── classification-analysis.md # How project was classified
├── 01_prd.md                  # Generated documents based on tier
├── 03_generate_tasks.md
├── 14_project_brief.md
├── 15_brainstorming.md
└── [additional docs based on tier selection]
```

## 🔧 Implementation Steps I'm Taking

### **Step 1: Template Extraction and Embedding**
**Action:** Reading all 22 templates from `/home/jeremy/ai-dev/professional-templates/`
**Process:**
1. Use Read tool to extract each template's complete content
2. Convert to embedded string variables in command file
3. Preserve all formatting, metadata, and cross-references
4. Maintain {{DATE}} placeholders for dynamic replacement

**Expected Outcome:** Complete template library available within command file

### **Step 2: Intelligent Classification Logic Implementation**
**Action:** Building the response analysis engine
**Process:**
1. Create keyword detection arrays for each classification type
2. Implement linguistic pattern matching for project complexity
3. Build decision tree for automatic tier routing
4. Add industry-specific intelligence (FinTech, HealthTech, etc.)

**Expected Outcome:** Claude can automatically route users to optimal documentation tier

### **Step 3: Document Generation Engine**
**Action:** Creating the template population and file generation system
**Process:**
1. Build content replacement logic using user responses
2. Implement {{DATE}} replacement with current date
3. Create cross-reference updating system
4. Add quality validation and error handling

**Expected Outcome:** Professional documents generated automatically from user conversation

### **Step 4: Project Directory Management**
**Action:** Implementing file system operations and organization
**Process:**
1. Create project directory structure automatically
2. Generate index.md with navigation and summary
3. Create metadata tracking for audit trails
4. Implement naming conventions and organization

**Expected Outcome:** Complete, professionally organized project directories

### **Step 5: User Experience Optimization**
**Action:** Polishing the conversation flow and completion messaging
**Process:**
1. Refine conversational prompts for naturalness
2. Add progress indicators and time estimates
3. Create comprehensive completion messaging
4. Implement graceful error handling and recovery

**Expected Outcome:** Smooth, delightful user experience from start to finish

**Total Estimated Time:** 3 hours for complete implementation

## ⚠️ Potential Challenges & Mitigation

### **Challenge 1: Large File Size**
**Risk:** Command file becomes very large with 22 embedded templates
**Mitigation:** Optimize template storage, remove unnecessary whitespace, test Claude Code CLI limits

### **Challenge 2: Template Formatting Preservation**
**Risk:** Embedded templates lose formatting or structure
**Mitigation:** Careful string escaping, preserve exact whitespace, test generation output

### **Challenge 3: Classification Accuracy**
**Risk:** Automatic routing misclassifies projects
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive keyword lists, fallback questions, allow user override

### **Challenge 4: Error Handling Complexity**
**Risk:** Edge cases cause generation failures
**Mitigation:** Graceful degradation, partial generation capability, clear error messages
