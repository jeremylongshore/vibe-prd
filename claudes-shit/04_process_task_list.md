## 🔄 1. Workflow Framework & Board Configuration

### 1.1 Agent-Specialized Kanban Structure
**Primary Flow:**
```
📋 Backlog → 🔍 Ready → 🏗️ In Progress → 👀 Review → ✅ Done
```

**Agent-Specific Columns:**
| Column | Purpose | WIP Limit | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Agent Coordination |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **📋 Backlog** | All identified work | ∞ | Task created from Epic breakdown | Acceptance criteria defined | All agents contribute |
| **🔍 Ready** | Agent-ready tasks | 15 | DoR satisfied | Agent assigned | Daily standups assign work |
| **🏗️ In Progress** | Active development | 6 | Work started by agent | Code/deliverable complete | Agent status updates |
| **👀 Cross-Review** | Inter-agent validation | 5 | Deliverable submitted | Peer agent approval | Agent collaboration |
| **🧪 Integration Testing** | System-level validation | 8 | Component complete | Tests passing | DevOps Troubleshooter |
| **🚀 Release Staging** | Pre-deployment validation | 3 | Tests passed | Stakeholder approval | All agents coordinate |
| **✅ Done** | Completed work | ∞ | DoD satisfied | Production deployed | Success metrics tracked |

### 1.2 Agent Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits
**Individual Agent Capacity:**
- **SEO-Content-Writer Agent:** Max 3 tasks in progress (content creation focus)
- **Documentation Architect Agent:** Max 2 tasks in progress (deep documentation work)
- **Python Pro Agent:** Max 2 tasks in progress (complex implementation tasks)
- **JavaScript Pro Agent:** Max 3 tasks in progress (frontend development velocity)
- **Frontend Developer Agent:** Max 2 tasks in progress (UI/UX design intensive)
- **DevOps Troubleshooter Agent:** Max 4 tasks in progress (support role across agents)

**Rationale:** Limits based on task complexity and agent specialization to maintain quality while maximizing throughput.

| **DevOps Troubleshooter** | GitHub Actions integration | 40 hours | Auto-documentation on PR |

**Parallel Work Streams:**
- Frontend Developer and Python Pro can work independently
- DevOps integration depends on both previous deliverables
- Quality assurance requires coordination across all agents

#### **Sprint 4: Community & Launch Week (Days 22-28)**
**Sprint Goal:** #1 trending repository status achieved through community features and viral growth

**Agent Assignments & Capacity:**

## 🎯 3. Task Prioritization & Backlog Management

### 3.1 Priority Framework

#### **Priority Classification System**
- **P0 (Blockers):** Must complete for launch, blocks other work
- **P1 (Critical):** High impact on success metrics, required for competitive positioning
- **P2 (Important):** Nice to have, enhances user experience but not launch-critical
- **P3 (Future):** Post-launch enhancements, community requests

#### **Current Sprint Backlog (Prioritized)**

##### **P0 Tasks (Must Complete)**
| Task ID | Task Name | Agent | Estimate | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 2.1 | Claude CLI Command Implementation | Python Pro | 3 days | Task 1.2 complete | Medium |
| 2.2 | Cursor IDE Integration | JavaScript Pro | 2 days | Task 2.1 complete | Medium |
| 2.3 | Tiered Template System | Python Pro | 3 days | Task 2.1 complete | Low |
| 1.1 | Repository SEO Optimization | SEO-Content-Writer | 1 day | Competitive research | Low |
| 1.2 | Essential GitHub Files | Documentation Architect | 2 days | None | Low |

##### **P1 Tasks (High Priority)**
| Task ID | Task Name | Agent | Estimate | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 3.1 | GitHub Pages Site | Frontend Developer | 3 days | Task 2.3 complete | Medium |
| 3.2 | Export Capabilities | Python Pro | 3 days | Task 2.4 complete | High |
| 1.3 | README Algorithm Optimization | SEO-Content-Writer | 2 days | Task 1.1 complete | Low |
| 2.4 | Cross-Platform Testing | DevOps Troubleshooter | 2 days | Tasks 2.1, 2.2 | High |

##### **P2 Tasks (Important)**
| Task ID | Task Name | Agent | Estimate | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 4.1 | Template Marketplace | Frontend Developer | 3 days | Task 3.1 complete | Medium |
| 4.2 | Viral Growth Mechanisms | JavaScript Pro | 2 days | Task 3.1 complete | Low |
| 3.3 | GitHub Actions Integration | DevOps Troubleshooter | 2 days | Task 3.2 complete | Medium |

### 3.2 Backlog Refinement Process

#### **Weekly Backlog Refinement (Wednesdays)**
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Participants:** All 6 agents
- **Agenda:**
  1. Review completed tasks and lessons learned (15 min)
  2. Estimate new tasks discovered during development (20 min)
  3. Re-prioritize backlog based on current progress (15 min)
  4. Identify risks and mitigation strategies (10 min)

#### **Task Estimation Guidelines**
- **1 day (8 hours):** Simple implementation, well-defined requirements
- **2 days (16 hours):** Moderate complexity, some unknowns, requires research
- **3 days (24 hours):** Complex implementation, multiple dependencies, integration required
- **>3 days:** Break down into smaller tasks

## 🚨 5. Risk Management & Escalation Procedures

### 5.1 Risk Assessment Matrix

#### **Technical Risks**
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Cross-platform output inconsistency | Medium | High | High | Shared generation engine, automated testing | DevOps Troubleshooter |
| Question flow complexity breaks UX | Medium | High | High | Start simple, iterate based on feedback | Python Pro |
| GitHub algorithm changes reduce ranking | Low | Medium | Medium | Diversify traffic sources, focus on organic value | SEO-Content-Writer |
| Agent coordination failures | Medium | Medium | Medium | Daily standups, clear dependencies, escalation | All Agents |

#### **Business Risks**
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Competitor launches similar feature | Medium | High | High | Speed of execution, unique value proposition | All Agents |
| Enterprise adoption slower than expected | Medium | Medium | Medium | Focus on developer experience first | Frontend Developer |
| Community engagement lower than projected | Low | Medium | Low | Authentic value creation, genuine utility | SEO-Content-Writer |

### 5.2 Escalation Procedures

#### **Issue Escalation Levels**
1. **Level 1 - Agent Self-Resolution:** Agent attempts to resolve within 4 hours
2. **Level 2 - Peer Agent Support:** Another agent provides assistance within 8 hours
3. **Level 3 - Team Escalation:** Daily standup discussion, team problem-solving
4. **Level 4 - Scope/Timeline Adjustment:** Modify deliverables or extend timeline

#### **Escalation Triggers**
- **Blocking Issue >8 hours:** Automatically escalate to Level 2
- **Cross-Agent Dependency Failure:** Immediately escalate to Level 3
- **Quality Gate Failure:** Escalate to Level 3 within 2 hours
- **Performance Benchmark Miss:** Escalate to Level 2 for optimization

### 5.3 Contingency Planning

#### **Schedule Compression Options**
If behind schedule, prioritize in this order:
1. **Maintain P0 tasks:** Core functionality must work
2. **Defer P2 tasks:** Community features can be post-launch
3. **Simplify P1 tasks:** Reduce feature complexity but maintain quality
4. **Add agent capacity:** Redistribute work or extend hours if needed

#### **Quality Assurance Fallbacks**
- **Cross-platform issues:** Fall back to Claude CLI only for launch
- **Performance problems:** Reduce comprehensive tier to 12 docs instead of 22
- **Integration failures:** Launch core features, add integrations post-launch
