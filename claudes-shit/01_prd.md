## 🚀 1. Product Vision & Problem Statement

### 1.1 One-Liner
**Product Vision:** "An intelligent /new-project command that transforms vibe-prd from a template library into a conversational documentation assistant, reducing project setup time from 15+ minutes to 5 minutes while increasing documentation completeness and driving GitHub algorithm dominance."

### 1.2 Problem Definition
- **Who hurts today:** Developers, product managers, startup founders, and enterprise teams needing comprehensive project documentation
- **Current pain points:**
  - Cognitive overhead: Users don't know what questions to ask themselves

  - Inconsistent documentation depth across different project types
  - No guidance for startup vs enterprise context requirements
- **Why now:**
  - AI documentation tools trending on GitHub (README-AI has 13.6k stars)
  - Anthropic's Claude Code CLI gaining widespread adoption
  - Enterprise demand for automated compliance documentation
  - Market gap for intelligent questioning + comprehensive templates
- **Cost of inaction:**
  - Continued user friction reduces adoption and GitHub ranking
  - Competitors gaining market share in AI documentation space
  - Missing revenue opportunity in enterprise documentation automation

**Problem Validation:**
