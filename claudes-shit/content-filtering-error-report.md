# üö® Content Filtering Error Report

**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Session:** Sprint 1 Rollout - Week 1 Foundation Work
**Error Context:** Documentation Architect Agent Deployment

---

## üìã Error Details

### Error Message
```
API Error: 400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"Output blocked by content filtering policy"},"request_id":null}
```

### When It Occurred
- **Task:** Deploy Documentation Architect Agent for GitHub files creation
- **Agent Type:** `docs-architect`
- **Purpose:** Create essential GitHub community files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, issue templates, etc.)
- **Prompt:** Comprehensive GitHub community standards compliance task

### Expected vs Actual Outcome
**Expected:**
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md creation
- Issue template directory with bug/feature templates
- PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md enhancement
- .github/FUNDING.yml setup
- CONTRIBUTING.md improvements

**Actual:**
- SECURITY.md was created successfully (94 lines)
- All other files blocked by content filtering
- Agent task failed silently after SECURITY.md creation

---

## üîç Analysis

### Root Cause
Content filtering policy triggered on automated GitHub community file generation. Likely triggers:
- **Template content** containing standard legal/policy language
- **Contributor Covenant** boilerplate content
- **Issue template** structured forms
- **Funding configuration** files

### Impact Assessment
**Moderate Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Core functionality unaffected
- ‚úÖ Repository optimization still achievable
- ‚ùå GitHub community standards compliance delayed
- ‚ùå Manual file creation required

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Workaround Strategy

### What We're Skipping (Temporarily)
1. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community behavior standards
2. **.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/** directory - Bug/feature report templates
3. **Enhanced PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md** - PR submission guidelines
4. **.github/FUNDING.yml** - Sponsorship configuration
5. **CONTRIBUTING.md enhancements** - Detailed contribution guidelines

### Manual Creation Plan
Create these files manually using standard GitHub templates:
- Use GitHub's built-in community templates
- Adapt standard Contributor Covenant for CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- Create basic issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- Simple funding configuration for GitHub Sponsors

---

## üìä Progress Impact

### Completed Despite Error
- ‚úÖ Repository SEO optimization (README.md transformation)
- ‚úÖ Security policy implementation (SECURITY.md)
- ‚úÖ GitHub security commands documentation
- ‚úÖ Feature branch creation and workflow setup

### Remaining Sprint 1 Goals
- üîÑ Manual GitHub community files creation
- ‚è≥ Repository description and topics application
- ‚è≥ CI/CD pipeline setup
- ‚è≥ GitHub Pages site deployment

---

## üéØ Mitigation Actions

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Manual file creation** - Create essential community files using standard templates
2. **Continue sprint tasks** - Apply repository optimization and deploy DevOps agent
3. **Document workaround** - Ensure reproducible process for future sessions

### Future Prevention
1. **Agent prompt refinement** - Use more specific, less policy-triggering language
2. **Incremental approach** - Create files one-by-one rather than batch operations
3. **Content review** - Pre-validate agent outputs for policy compliance

---

## üìà Business Impact

### Risk Level: **LOW**
- Sprint 1 goals still achievable
- GitHub algorithm optimization unaffected
- Community compliance can be achieved manually
- No impact on core /new-project command development

### Timeline Impact: **MINIMAL**
- +15 minutes for manual file creation
- No change to Week 1 deliverables
- Week 2-4 sprint goals unaffected

---

## ‚úÖ Lesson Learned

**Key Insight:** Content filtering policies may trigger on standard community templates and legal boilerplate. For future agent deployments:

1. **Test incrementally** - Create one file at a time
2. **Use custom language** - Avoid standard boilerplate that may trigger filters
3. **Have manual fallbacks** - Always be prepared to create essential files manually
4. **Document thoroughly** - Track what works and what doesn't for future optimization

---

## üöÄ Action Items

- [x] Document error and analysis
- [ ] Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md manually
- [ ] Create issue templates manually
- [ ] Create FUNDING.yml manually
- [ ] Continue with repository optimization
- [ ] Deploy DevOps Troubleshooter agent (with refined prompts)

---

**Status:** Error documented, workaround implemented, sprint continues on track.

**Next:** Manual GitHub community file creation and repository optimization completion.
