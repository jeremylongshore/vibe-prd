**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Outcome:** Complete feature design from concept to implementation plan
**Participants:** User (Jeremy) + Claude Code AI Assistant

> **ðŸ’¡ This is a real transcript showing how the `/new-project` intelligent intake command was designed and implemented. Use this as an example of how AI-assisted development can accelerate your workflow from idea to production-ready feature.**

## ðŸš€ Session Flow: From Problem to Solution

### **Initial Problem Statement**
**User:** "i want to be able to make a command that will currently make claude create those documents folder after it asks me a series of questions regarding a feature update or a new product i want to build"

**Key Pain Points Identified:**
- Multiple separate commands (/create-prd, /create-adr, /generate-tasks, /process-tasks)
- Cognitive overhead: "I don't know what questions to ask myself"
- Time-consuming setup process (15+ minutes for comprehensive docs)
- No guidance for different project contexts (startup vs enterprise)

### **Discovery Questions That Led to Breakthrough Design**

#### **Question 1: Scope Clarification**
**Claude:** "Do you want this command to generate just the 4 core docs (PRD, ADR, Tasks, Process Tasks) or all 22 templates?"

**User Response:** "i want it to give me an option of 4 or all 22"

**ðŸ’¡ Design Impact:** Led to **dual-scope architecture** with Foundation (4) vs Comprehensive (22) paths.

#### **Question 2: User Segmentation**
**Claude:** "Should the questions be different for 'new product' vs 'feature update'?"

**User Response:** "basically there should be an option for a person with an idea and a person with an existing product/system"

**ðŸ’¡ Design Impact:** Created **Greenfield vs Brownfield** project classification system.

#### **Question 3: Target Audience**
**Claude:** "Target audience/users? Technical constraints/requirements? Business goals/success metrics?"

**User Response:** "target audience is start ups, existing business and enterprise - maybe we need templates for each category maybe an mvp category that isn't in depth"

**ðŸ’¡ Design Impact:** Developed **tiered template system** (Startup/Business/Enterprise) with context-aware questioning.

#### **Question 4: Platform Support**
**User:** "oh yeah i forgot this has to work for cursor too some how... this is geared strictly to claude code users in the terminal (instructions should tell users how to access cli from gui) and cursor users"

**ðŸ’¡ Design Impact:** Expanded to **dual-platform implementation** (Claude CLI + Cursor IDE) with GUI access instructions.

#### **Question 5: Integration Strategy**
**Claude:** "Should it create a new project folder in completed-docs/ automatically?"

**User Response:** "it should create a new project folder where user tells you to example would be jeremy/projects for me"

**ðŸ’¡ Design Impact:** **User-specified directory creation** with flexible project organization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Breakthrough Moments

### **Moment 1: Command Consolidation Insight**
**User Statement:** "to answer six is yes i dont know all the questions to ask and also its way too many commands"

**Solution Generated:** Single `/new-project` command with intelligent question flows replacing 4+ separate commands.

### **Moment 2: Adaptive Questioning Logic**
**User Requirement:** "if ai determines it needs more questions to clarify then it should make that decision"

**Solution Generated:** Smart follow-up system that analyzes responses and asks clarifying questions when needed.

### **Moment 3: Documentation as Feature**
**User Request:** "please create this document your documented response and then report back and wait for further instruction"

**Solution Generated:** Comprehensive analysis and design documentation that became the foundation for implementation.

## ðŸ“‹ Exact Questions That Shaped the Design

### **Classification Questions (Final Design)**
1. **"Are you: (A) Starting with an idea (Greenfield - new concept), (B) Building on existing product/system (Brownfield - enhancement)?"**
2. **"Primary audience: (A) Startup (lean/agile), (B) Existing Business (standard), (C) Enterprise (compliance-heavy)?"**
3. **"Generate: (A) Foundation docs (4 core - 5 min), (B) Comprehensive suite (22 docs - 15 min)?"**

### **Adaptive Follow-up Examples**
- **Greenfield + Startup:** "What's your minimum viable feature set?"
- **Brownfield + Enterprise:** "What compliance requirements apply (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA)?"
- **Any + Comprehensive:** Deep-dive questions for each of the 22 templates

## ðŸ›  Technical Decisions Made During Session

### **Architecture Choices**
1. **Markdown-based commands** (not Node.js apps) for zero setup
2. **Template composition** (not modification) to preserve template library
3. **Dual platform support** (Claude CLI + Cursor IDE) for universal access
4. **Self-contained project directories** with index.md navigation

### **User Experience Decisions**
1. **Conversational flow** for Claude CLI (natural questioning)
2. **Structured prompts** for Cursor IDE (form-like workflow)
3. **GUI-to-CLI instructions** for non-terminal users
4. **Intelligent adaptation** based on user responses

## ðŸ“Š Metrics and Success Criteria Established

### **Performance Targets**
- **Time to First Doc:** <5 minutes (from 15+ minutes)
- **Command Reduction:** 1 command vs 4+ separate commands
- **User Completion Rate:** >90% successful documentation generation
- **Template Generation:** <30 seconds for all 22 documents

### **User Experience Goals**
- **Cognitive Load:** Eliminate "what questions to ask" problem
- **Platform Accessibility:** Support both Claude CLI and Cursor IDE users
- **Documentation Quality:** Maintain professional template standards
- **Workflow Integration:** Preserve existing workflows while adding new capability
