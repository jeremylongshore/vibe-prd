# README Diff Summary
**Date**: 2025-09-16

## Major Changes

### Before (BMAD-integrated workflow)
- Complex multi-step workflow with Docker/BMAD
- Required form input system
- Multiple make commands (ai-dev, prd, bmad-run, etc.)
- Extensive documentation about BMAD integration
- ~100+ lines of instructions

### After (Claude-only workflow)
- Simple 2-step process
- No Docker or BMAD dependencies
- Single Claude Code CLI paste command
- Clean, minimal documentation
- ~40 lines total

## Key Differences

1. **Setup**: Clone → Paste (2 steps vs. multiple)
2. **Dependencies**: None (vs. Docker, BMAD, Node.js)
3. **Workflow**: One paste (vs. make ai-dev → make prd)
4. **Output**: Same 22 docs, simpler process
5. **Complexity**: Beginner-friendly vs. developer-focused

## Removed Sections
- BMAD integration details
- Form system instructions
- Docker container commands
- Complex make targets
- AI assistant prompts references
- Legacy workflow examples

## Added Sections
- Simple one-paste prompt
- Clear output description
- Minimal repo layout
- Basic verify command

## Result
README reduced from complex technical documentation to simple user guide while maintaining same output capability.
