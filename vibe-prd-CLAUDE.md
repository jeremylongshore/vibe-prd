# Project Brief

## Overview
# PRD Input: Soccer Journey App (Gamified AI MVP)

## Target Users
Most apps track stats; this one adds **AI gamification**â€”quests, streaks, and achievementsâ€”making the grind fun while building discipline.

## Value Proposition
We are building an AI-driven gamified soccer app for iPhone that helps players track progress, develop skills, and stay motivated. The app combines performance tracking (juggles, shots, scrimmages, practices) with gamification features like points, levels, and streaks to make training fun. AI generates personalized insights, training recommendations, and highlights player achievements over time. Our goal is to give every soccer player â€” from youth athletes to club competitors â€” a personal AI coach in their pocket that turns practice into progress.

## Goals
1.	User Engagement â†’ Achieve 5,000+ daily active users (DAU) within the first 6 months after launch, measured via in-app analytics.

## Constraints
