# Claude One-Paste: Install + Run `/new-project`

**What the user pastes into Claude Code chat:**

```
https://github.com/jeremylongshore/vibe-prd.git
Claude, do the following on my machine:
1. If ~/ai-dev is missing, clone the repo there:
   ‚Ä¢ if [ -d ~/ai-dev/.git ]; then cd ~/ai-dev && git fetch --all && git checkout feature/new-project-command && git pull; else git clone --branch feature/new-project-command https://github.com/jeremylongshore/vibe-prd.git ~/ai-dev && cd ~/ai-dev; fi
2. Verify Node 18+: node -v
3. Write ~/.claude/commands/new-project.md using docs/claude_commands/new-project.md from this repo.
4. Run: node scripts/test-new-project.mjs
5. Tell the user: "Ready. Type /new-project to begin."
```

**Notes:**
- Always read templates from `~/ai-dev/professional-templates/`
- Write output docs to `~/ai-dev/completed-docs/<project>`

## How It Works

### Step 1: User Pastes Into Claude Code
User copies the above commands and pastes into any Claude Code chat session.

### Step 2: Claude Installs Everything
Claude automatically:
- Clones or updates the vibe-prd repo to `~/ai-dev`
- Switches to the `feature/new-project-command` branch
- Installs the `/new-project` command to their Claude CLI
- Tests the installation
- Confirms readiness

### Step 3: User Types `/new-project`
From any directory, user can now type `/new-project` and get:
- Intelligent conversation about their project
- Automatic classification (Greenfield/Brownfield, MVP/Standard/Enterprise)
- Professional documentation generated in `~/ai-dev/completed-docs/<project-name>/`
